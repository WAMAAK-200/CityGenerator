# CityGenerator

## How to run

Run the CityGenerator.py file for the main city generation functionalities. Customise the settings to what you desire then generate the map. Afterwards you should see an image pop up with this map alongside some statistics.

For Unity and Godot integration and conversion to 3D, first have a map be generated by the program then export the maps to JSON. Afterwards, run the UnityCityIntegration.cs script in Unity. For Godot, run the GodotCityIntegration.gd script in Godot. In both cases, make sure that you have added the JSON files to the Unity/Godot project as well as the script to the respective project in order for them to run.
