# CityGenerator

This was made as part of Royal Hackaway v9

This is an interactive city generator that creates a 3D map then exports it to JSON so that it can be integrated into Unity or Godot to produce a 3D map.

## How to run

Run the CityGenerator.py file for the main city generation functionalities.You should see an image containing the generated 2D map

For Unity and Godot integration and conversion to 3D, first have a map be generated by the program then export the maps to JSON. Afterwards, run the UnityCityIntegration.cs script in Unity. For Godot, run the GodotCityIntegration.gd script in Godot. In both cases, make sure that you have added the JSON files to the Unity/Godot project as well as the script to the respective project in order for them to run.
